# Learning JavaScript

This repository contains all the basic files for learning JavaScript. This should be seen from the perspective of a developer who knows the very basic concepts, e.g - `variables`,`data types`,`functions` etc.

## Objects

- Constructor function
- Factory function
- Dynamic nature of objects.
- Primitive vs reference types.
- Object iteration
- Object cloning
- Array iteration vs object iteration
- Date constructor and different formats of date
- Blog related practice, using constructor

## Arrays

- Array operations ( adding, removing, slicing, emptying etc), using loops, spread operator etc.
- Joining, splitting array and string
- Iterating over arrray
- Sorting value and reference type arrays
- Array methods ( every, some etc.)
- Filtering arrays
- Array Map
- Chaining Array methods
- Array reduce method

## Functions  

- Declaration and Expression
- Hoisting
- Arguments
- Rest operator
- Default parameter
- Getters and Setters
- Try catch block
- Scope, local, global
- var vs let keyword
- Functions are objects, methods of a function.
- this keyword, issues with this keyword in old JS version, multiple solution methods to properly use 'this' keyword
- closures

## OOP Concepts

- Inheritance : Retaining similar implementation, creating hierarchy -> base class/super class -> subclass => Eliminates redundant code.
- Encapsulation : Bundling data & methods operating on the data in single unit => Reduce complexity + increase reusability
- Data Abstraction : Hiding unnecessary data from outer world, e.g - DVD Player => Reduces complexity + Impact of changes
- Polymorphism : Function, variable or object taking different forms. e.g - talking is different for cow and dog => Refractor ugly switch case statements.

### OOP applications

- Getters and Setters using constructor property
- Data abstractions
- Prototypes
- Constructor and prototypes properties
- Adding own method to prototypes
- Iterating prototype and instance (own) member functions
- Property Descriptors
- Prototypical inheritance
- Avoiding personal built-in objects
- Creating my own prototypical inheritance
- Resetting the constructor
- Calling super constructor with .call method
- Intermediate function Inheritance
- Method Overriding
- Polymorphism
- When to use Inheritance
